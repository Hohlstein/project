This project is going to be 3 functions in one little desktop application. That functions beeing notebook, calendar and like in github a site to manage the backlog of all your projects.
The transition from to to the other will happen smoothly in the project when it is finished but in the beginning the user is asked upon starting the application.

Help is always welcome!
